# Abstract

Through a series of examples in number theory, we demonstrate the utility of machine
learning in conjecture formulation and pattern recognition in mathematics. We show
how renowned results, such as the prime number theorem and the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, could have been discovered using generic machine
learning techniques. Recent conjectures that arose from machine learning will also be
highlighted.
